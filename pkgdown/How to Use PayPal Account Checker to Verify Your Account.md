Verifying your account proves that you own the financial details added to your account, such as your bank account or credit card. It also helps PayPal comply with legal regulations and prevent fraud and identity theft. Verified accounts have higher limits, lower fees, and more features than unverified accounts.
 
So how do you verify your PayPal account? There are two main ways: adding and confirming a bank account, or applying for and being approved for a PayPal Credit product. In this article, we will show you how to use PayPal Account Checker to verify your account using either method.
 
## What is PayPal Account Checker?
